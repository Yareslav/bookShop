Rowling’s characters, have kept fans enthralled with and puzzling over the many mysteries that permeate Hogwarts and beyond: • Do the Harry Potter books encourage disobedience? • Why is everyone so fascinated by Professor Lupin? • What exactly will Harry and his friends do when they finally pass those N.E.W.T.s? • Do even wizards live by the ticking of the clock? • Is Harry destined to end up alone? And why did it take Ron and Hermione so long to get together? Now, in The Psychology of Harry Potter, leading psychologists delve into the ultimate Chamber of Secrets, analyzing human mind and motivation by examining the themes and characters that make the Harry Potter books the bestselling fantasy series of all time.

Rowling's wondrous world of magic that has captured the imaginations of millions on both the printed page and the silver screen with bestselling novels and blockbuster films. The true magic found in this children's fantasy series lies not only in its appeal to people of all ages but in its connection to the greater world of classic literature. Harry Potter's Bookshelf: The Great Books Behind the Hogwarts Adventures explores the literary landscape of themes and genres J.K. Rowling artfully wove throughout her novels-and the influential authors and stories that inspired her. From Jane Austen's Emma and Charles Dickens's class struggles, through the gothic romances of Dracula and Frankenstein and the detective mysteries of Dorothy L. Sayers, to the dramatic alchemy of C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and William Shakespeare, Rowling cast a powerful spell with the great books of English literature that transformed the story of a young wizard into a worldwide pop culture phenomenon.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781101133132"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1101133139"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":336,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Social Science"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":7,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.1.3.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2I_5zwnAEZ8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=2I_5zwnAEZ8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=2I_5zwnAEZ8C&pg=PT50&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&cd=20&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2I_5zwnAEZ8C&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2I_5zwnAEZ8C"},"saleInfo":{"country":"UA","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":227.82,"currencyCode":"UAH"},"retailPrice":{"amount":227.82,"currencyCode":"UAH"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2I_5zwnAEZ8C&rdid=book-2I_5zwnAEZ8C&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":227820000,"currencyCode":"UAH"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":227820000,"currencyCode":"UAH"}}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"UA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books/download/Harry_Potter_s_Bookshelf-sample-epub.acsm?id=2I_5zwnAEZ8C&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=2I_5zwnAEZ8C&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Gothic Romance: The Spooky Atmosphere Formula from Transylvania <b>Harry Potter</b> as an Echo of the Brontë Sisters, Frankenstein, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Dracula Gothic as a literary genre was born in the&nbsp;..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"Y0HbmAEACAAJ","etag":"eDTgLfHeejI","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/Y0HbmAEACAAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","authors":["J.

The seven Harry Potter books have sold more than 350 million copies in 200 countries and the films are one of the highest grossing film series of all time.

Spanning the ‘tweenager’ and ‘tweenie’ age zones young people of this age are increasingly fashion-aware, media-savvy and worldly-wise. They don’t regard themselves as children but are not yet adults. This new book addresses both the need and the cultural interest.In 12 sessions, Mixing it up with Harry Potter draws parallels between events in the Harry Potter world, and the world in which our young people live. These parallels allow you to explore Christian concepts with your young people and engage with the Christian faith through the themes demonstrated – from complex subjects such as Sacrifice and Mercy, to everyday issues such as Fitting in and Boasting – with an introduction to the book covering all you need to consider in terms of health and safety, child protection, and how to handle the aspects of Harry Potter that are not always very godly.Mixing it up with Harry Potter will help young people to delight in their faith and encourage them to see that a relationship with God is even more enchanting than a visit to Hogwarts!Each session is divided into five parts and includes photocopiable material: · Beforehand (to help leaders prepare the session)· Opening Activity (introducing the session to the young people in an interactive and fun format)· Film Clip (a short clip from one of the Harry Potter films)· Taking It Further (developing the theme and exploring it in greater depth)· Bible Focus (a Bible verse that deals with the Christian perspective of the theme)· Prayer Response (prayer activity drawing on the theme and giving space for response)","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0715141066"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780715141069"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":35,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Church work with youth"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.2.3.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r0q9GTKO0qUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r0q9GTKO0qUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=r0q9GTKO0qUC&pg=PR11&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=r0q9GTKO0qUC&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Mixing_it_Up_With_Harry_Potter.html?hl=&id=r0q9GTKO0qUC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"UA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"UA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=r0q9GTKO0qUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In answer to this concern , I think it should be clear that these sessions do not build upon the Christian elements of the <b>Harry Potter</b> stories , as the author has never claimed that these elements exist .

Each chapter of Literary Allusion in Harry Potter consists of an in-depth discussion of the intersection between Harry Potter and a canonical literary work, such as the plays of Shakespeare, the poetry of Homer, Ovid, the Gawain-poet, Chaucer, Milton and Tennyson, and the novels of Austen, Hardy and Dickens. This approach aims to transform the reader’s understanding of Rowling’s literary achievement as well as to encourage the discovery of works with which they may be less familiar.

Rowling published her first Harry Potter novel in 1997, probably nobody expected the tremendous success her writing debut was going to bring her. The huge popularity of the seven-book series led not only to an equally successful series of film adaptations, but also to a variety of well selling merchandise. Children and adults alike are enchanted by the wizarding world that Rowling so meticulously created. However, Rowling’s story does not only serve as a source for our entertainment, she also uses her fantasy world as a metaphor for our own world, depicting rights and wrongs in many different fields. One of the main themes is even a very controversial one: discrimination. And Rowling did not just invent a world in black and white, she does not simply tell the reader that prejudice is a reprehensible trait in our society. Rather, she created a world for the readers to explore and find things out for themselves as the story continued. In this paper, the author claims that the representation of discrimination in the Harry Potter series influences the readers in a positive way and that they are likely less prejudiced against stigmatised groups after reading the books.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783960671640"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3960671644"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":36,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Language Arts & Disciplines"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.0.0.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RKwyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RKwyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=RKwyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA29&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=RKwyDwAAQBAJ&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Changing_Readers_Attitudes_The_Represent.html?hl=&id=RKwyDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"UA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"UA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=RKwyDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Racial otherness and the <b>Harry Potter</b> series, n.p. 2013. ebook.

But alchemy is not about money or eternal life, it is much more about the transformations of desire, of power and of people--through love. Harry's equally remarkable and ordinary power to love leads to his desire to find but not use the Philosopher's Stone at the start of the series and his wish to end the destructive power of the Elder Wand at the end. This collection of essays on alchemical symbolism and transformations in Rowling's series demonstrates how Harry's work with magical objects, people, and creatures transfigure desire, power, and identity. As Harry's leaden existence on Privet Drive is transformed in the company of his friends and teachers, the Harry Potter novels have transformed millions of readers, inspiring us to find the gold in our ordinary lives.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781476681344"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1476681341"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":323,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Criticism"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Alchemical_Harry_Potter.html?hl=&id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"UA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"UA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"SUNY, 1996.

These essays take on the consideration of Rowling's work as being worthy of study as a phenomenon and influence, as well as a work of literary value. They add genuine statistical information about the reasons for the books' popularity, consider their effects on child readers, and examine some deep-rooted reasons for their having been manipulated in American publishing, in film adaptations, in musical complements, and in their thingification in popular culture around the world. Some of these essays take on the critics of the books' religion and considerations of psychological, as well as philosophical good and evil, and well as some stylistic anomalies.

The seven Harry Potter books have sold more than 350 million copies in 200 countries and the films are one of the highest grossing film series of all time.

Spanning the ‘tweenager’ and ‘tweenie’ age zones young people of this age are increasingly fashion-aware, media-savvy and worldly-wise. They don’t regard themselves as children but are not yet adults. This new book addresses both the need and the cultural interest.In 12 sessions, Mixing it up with Harry Potter draws parallels between events in the Harry Potter world, and the world in which our young people live. These parallels allow you to explore Christian concepts with your young people and engage with the Christian faith through the themes demonstrated – from complex subjects such as Sacrifice and Mercy, to everyday issues such as Fitting in and Boasting – with an introduction to the book covering all you need to consider in terms of health and safety, child protection, and how to handle the aspects of Harry Potter that are not always very godly.Mixing it up with Harry Potter will help young people to delight in their faith and encourage them to see that a relationship with God is even more enchanting than a visit to Hogwarts!Each session is divided into five parts and includes photocopiable material: · Beforehand (to help leaders prepare the session)· Opening Activity (introducing the session to the young people in an interactive and fun format)· Film Clip (a short clip from one of the Harry Potter films)· Taking It Further (developing the theme and exploring it in greater depth)· Bible Focus (a Bible verse that deals with the Christian perspective of the theme)· Prayer Response (prayer activity drawing on the theme and giving space for response)","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0715141066"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780715141069"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":35,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Church work with youth"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.2.3.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r0q9GTKO0qUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r0q9GTKO0qUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=r0q9GTKO0qUC&pg=PR11&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&cd=23&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=r0q9GTKO0qUC&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Mixing_it_Up_With_Harry_Potter.html?hl=&id=r0q9GTKO0qUC"},"saleInfo":{"country":"UA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"UA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=r0q9GTKO0qUC&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In answer to this concern , I think it should be clear that these sessions do not build upon the Christian elements of the <b>Harry Potter</b> stories , as the author has never claimed that these elements exist .

K. Rowling’s series in order to introduce its readers to some of the great works of literature on which Rowling draws. Harry Potter’s narrative techniques are rooted in the western literary tradition and its allusiveness provides insight into Rowling’s fictional world. Each chapter of Literary Allusion in Harry Potter consists of an in-depth discussion of the intersection between Harry Potter and a canonical literary work, such as the plays of Shakespeare, the poetry of Homer, Ovid, the Gawain-poet, Chaucer, Milton and Tennyson, and the novels of Austen, Hardy and Dickens. This approach aims to transform the reader’s understanding of Rowling’s literary achievement as well as to encourage the discovery of works with which they may be less familiar. The aim of this book is to delight Potter fans with a new perspective on their favourite books while harnessing that enthusiasm to increase their wider appreciation of literature.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781351978736"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"135197873X"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":196,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Criticism"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&cd=28&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Literary_Allusion_in_Harry_Potter.html?hl=&id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"UA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"UA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Grimes, M.

Rowling published her first Harry Potter novel in 1997, probably nobody expected the tremendous success her writing debut was going to bring her. The huge popularity of the seven-book series led not only to an equally successful series of film adaptations, but also to a variety of well selling merchandise. Children and adults alike are enchanted by the wizarding world that Rowling so meticulously created. However, Rowling’s story does not only serve as a source for our entertainment, she also uses her fantasy world as a metaphor for our own world, depicting rights and wrongs in many different fields. One of the main themes is even a very controversial one: discrimination. And Rowling did not just invent a world in black and white, she does not simply tell the reader that prejudice is a reprehensible trait in our society. Rather, she created a world for the readers to explore and find things out for themselves as the story continued. In this paper, the author claims that the representation of discrimination in the Harry Potter series influences the readers in a positive way and that they are likely less prejudiced against stigmatised groups after reading the books.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9783960671640"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"3960671644"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":36,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Language Arts & Disciplines"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.0.0.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RKwyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=RKwyDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=RKwyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA29&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&cd=35&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=RKwyDwAAQBAJ&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Changing_Readers_Attitudes_The_Represent.html?hl=&id=RKwyDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"UA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"UA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=RKwyDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Racial otherness and the <b>Harry Potter</b> series, n.p. 2013. ebook.

Mamary"],"publisher":"McFarland","publishedDate":"2020-12-22","description":"When Harry Potter first boards the Hogwarts Express, he journeys to a world which Rowling says has alchemy as its \"internal logic.\" The Philosopher's Stone, known for its power to transform base metals into gold and to give immortality to its maker, is the subject of the conflict between Harry and Voldemort in the first book of the series. But alchemy is not about money or eternal life, it is much more about the transformations of desire, of power and of people--through love. Harry's equally remarkable and ordinary power to love leads to his desire to find but not use the Philosopher's Stone at the start of the series and his wish to end the destructive power of the Elder Wand at the end. This collection of essays on alchemical symbolism and transformations in Rowling's series demonstrates how Harry's work with magical objects, people, and creatures transfigure desire, power, and identity. As Harry's leaden existence on Privet Drive is transformed in the company of his friends and teachers, the Harry Potter novels have transformed millions of readers, inspiring us to find the gold in our ordinary lives.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781476681344"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1476681341"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":323,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Criticism"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&cd=36&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Alchemical_Harry_Potter.html?hl=&id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"UA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"UA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"SUNY, 1996.

K. Rowling’s series in order to introduce its readers to some of the great works of literature on which Rowling draws. Harry Potter’s narrative techniques are rooted in the western literary tradition and its allusiveness provides insight into Rowling’s fictional world. Each chapter of Literary Allusion in Harry Potter consists of an in-depth discussion of the intersection between Harry Potter and a canonical literary work, such as the plays of Shakespeare, the poetry of Homer, Ovid, the Gawain-poet, Chaucer, Milton and Tennyson, and the novels of Austen, Hardy and Dickens. This approach aims to transform the reader’s understanding of Rowling’s literary achievement as well as to encourage the discovery of works with which they may be less familiar. The aim of this book is to delight Potter fans with a new perspective on their favourite books while harnessing that enthusiasm to increase their wider appreciation of literature.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781351978736"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"135197873X"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":196,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Criticism"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&cd=26&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Literary_Allusion_in_Harry_Potter.html?hl=&id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"UA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"UA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8P8nDwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Grimes, M.

But alchemy is not about money or eternal life, it is much more about the transformations of desire, of power and of people--through love. Harry's equally remarkable and ordinary power to love leads to his desire to find but not use the Philosopher's Stone at the start of the series and his wish to end the destructive power of the Elder Wand at the end. This collection of essays on alchemical symbolism and transformations in Rowling's series demonstrates how Harry's work with magical objects, people, and creatures transfigure desire, power, and identity. As Harry's leaden existence on Privet Drive is transformed in the company of his friends and teachers, the Harry Potter novels have transformed millions of readers, inspiring us to find the gold in our ordinary lives.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781476681344"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1476681341"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":323,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Literary Criticism"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&cd=31&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.ua/books?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&dq=harry+Potter&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Alchemical_Harry_Potter.html?hl=&id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"UA","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"UA","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=8fcQEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"SUNY, 1996.
